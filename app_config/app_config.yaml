# APP VERSIONING

# A simple form of versioning for apps (as opposed to libraries)

# Differences:
#     1. Only major.minor.patch is used, not any extra labels
#         Major for changes to user data
#         Minor for changes to features
#         Patch for fixes
#     2. App must always be stable on production domain
#         Only ever beta on production domain when version < 1
#     3. App is assumed unstable when on testing domain
#         Once new versions pass on testing domain they can move to production without changes
#         So production may jump versions if problems found


version: 1.5.1
theme_codes:
    # ALL colors must support both LARGE black/white contrast FOR their darker/lighter variants
    # AND preferable to also support for the base color as well!
    # NOTE Accent/error do NOT need to use accent colors (spec doesn't even) if mellower better
  primary: [blue_grey, p700]    # base color doesn't support white text (but sky needs to be light!)
  accent: [green, a400]    # base color supports both black/white text
  error: [red, a700]    # base color supports both black/white text
