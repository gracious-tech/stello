/* Typescript setup

 * There is one version of TS for the entire project for consistency with same rules
 * There is a base template that is extended by the node/browser templates
 * TS is used for type checking only, not compiling (ts-node/esbuild used instead)
    * So all tsconfigs do not emit JS, they just determine the rules for each dir/file
    * So "include" determines what is type checked, not bundled together...
 * Vue projects require vue-tsc and are browser rather than node, so have different tsconfigs
